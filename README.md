Enspired by the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vunwBbFx_F8) from Reactiive YouTube channel.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo.
3. Change directory to your project with `cd skeleton-animation` command.
4. Run `yarn start` to start the Metro bundler.

Please use the `npx expo eject` command to switch to the "bare" react-native app. See the [docs](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) to learn about the difference between managed and bare workflows.
